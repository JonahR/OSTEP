There is no easy way to tell how the process tree formed, but we
can make some good educated guesses based on the amount of actions
and the number of processes in the final tree.

For
```

                        Final Process Tree:
                               a
                               └── b
```

We know there are 5 actions. This means, there could be at a most 5 forks
with 6 different processes. In the final process tree, there are only
2 processes left. This means there were 3 forks and 2 exits. We can not
determine it which order this occured, but we do know the amount of forks
and exits. We can use the alphabet ordering to make an even better guess.
We know that a must fork b and this is the first action. We know the
second action then must be either a forks c or b forks c. After that, many things
can happen, but process d is created and exits, and process c exits at some
time.
