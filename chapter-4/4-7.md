The flow of control goes back to process 1 after it completes its I/O. It is a good idea to switch back
to a process after it finishes its I/O because if a process has issued 1 I/0, it is liekly to issue
another. Issuing I/O requests as soon as possible, allows other processes to issue their instructions
while waiting for the I/O to finish.
