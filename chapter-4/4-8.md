Using -S SWITCH_ON_END is the most inefficent way to schedule tasks. You do not have any effiency gains
from running other process's instructions while waiting on I/O to finish.

Using -I IO_RUN_LATER is more inneficient. This is because we could scedule the processes in such a way were
we come back to the last process to run that still has many expensive I/O operations left.
